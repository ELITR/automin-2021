Attendees: [PERSON27], [PERSON55], [PERSON53], [PERSON54], [PERSON56]

- [PERSON27] wants to discuss two things: evaluations and preparation for evaluation, shared task imitation
- [PERSON53] is working on automatic measures for evaluation
- [PERSON54] can report some progress on automatic evaluation by the end of the month
- [PERSON55] prepared a human evaluation protocol document which is to be used by annotators to evaluate the minutes
- [PERSON7] has shared a paper which can be referred to mimic the human evaluation
- [PERSON55] opines that the hard task for the annotators would be to read the two minutes and rate those against the evaluation criteria. Rest is a formula that needs to be computed based on the annotators ratings
- [PERSON27] asks [PERSON53] to create these guidelines
- [PERSON27] discusses the strategy to imitate the shared task. The dry run can oly happen when the evaluation guidelines are ready
- [PERSON54] formulated Task A and Task B for the shared task to distinguish between two minutes from the same meeting
- Evalutaion for Task A and B are easier and hence should be definitely included in the shared task
- [PERSON54] discusses the content of the shared task proposal
- Interspeech deadline on November 2020 for which [PERSON54] proposes to submit the proposal
- Anonymization of the data would be required before trial data release
- [PERSON54] asks [PERSON27] to share the link of the dataset statistics
- Discussion on how much data to prepare for the shared task
- [PERSON55] thinks that the long transcripts should be splitted to create more instances while [PERSON53] and [PERSON54] do not agree
- [PERSON27] thinks that the minuting data we have are unstructured and may not be appealing to the business companies
- [PERSON27] thinks to look at the European Parliament data
- [PERSON54] asks to [PERSON27] about the progress on Ethics Control
- [PERSON27] asks [PERSON54] to look at the consent form together
- [PERSON54] asks how to ensure that the data that they prepaare are of good quality?
- [PERSON54] asks for a schematic diagram of how the data is organized on the server
- Discussion on data organization, Github won't have the recordings
- [PERSON54] proposes not to use the original minutes as part of the shared task
- Next step is to come up with trial, train, validation, test sets 
- First release the trial data and after a month probably release the training data
- Apply the manual evaluation next week for a chosen meeting
- [PERSON54] demands some more clarity on [PERSON2]'s tool
- Next step is automatic evaluation of the minutes/summaries, use semantic metrics to evaluate
- [PERSON54] wants to discuss the submission platform, hiring somebody for the shared task
- Having a researcher experienced in summarization would be great for the proposal
- Some system runs to be submitted from the current group in the shared task, invite other nearby Czech universities for senior faculty!
- [PERSON27] proposes to include the Czech data in the shared task
- [PERSON54] is collaborating with [PERSON36] and [PERSON45] to draft the proposal
- [PERSON54] asks [PERSON27] about the status of her annotators. Probably 5 are working out of 20, 2 of them are working on Czech
- [PERSON27] discusses the speed of annotations, it's very subjective and depends on the speed, time of the annotators
- It's a good idea to gather large-scale data from European Parliament for the shared task
- [PERSON55] thinks that more data will be better
- [ORGANIZATION7] meetings are very long; 8 hours
- [PERSON55] thinks that longer meetings should be splitted
- [PERSON54] proposes to discuss data requirement, statistics for each of the tasks and data organization the next day
